The main goal is to be a place to hold malware-related code to study and tests.

#Pay Attention: 
YOU WILL FIND MANY MALICIOUS CODES HERE SO BE CAREFUL, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A WINDOWS USER. 
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS OR BAD USAGE OF THIS MATERIAL.

#DISCLAIMER:
I DO NOT created any code here probably just altered a bit to study the behavior of these scripts and programs.
